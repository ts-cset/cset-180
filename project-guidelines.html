  <h1>Project Guidelines</h1>

  <h2>Goal:</h2>

    The goal of this project is to emulate a real-world agency process to plan, design, and build a working web application according to client specifications and employer defined workflows.
  </p>

  <h2>Teams:</h2>

  <p>
    Each is composed of 3-4 developers. Among the team, you'll have to decide on a few roles. All members of the team have equal say in the product, the roles are not a hiearchy. They are just areas of focus and responsibiliy.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> This person is in charge of the project management software and will run the daily stand-up meetings and weekly planning days.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> This person is in charge of the git workflow, release cycle, and deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>Developers:</strong> This is everyone else. Without extra administrative duties, these people will produce the most code. They will own the features they build.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stand-Up:</h2>

  <p>
    Each team will have a daily stand-up meeting to discuss progress, blockers, and to schedule any necessary meetings. Your Scrum Master will run this meeting making sure it's focused and relevant to the assigned stories. This happens every day except for your planning day. Stand-ups should last no more than 10 minutes and each member should answer:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>What did you work on yesterday?</li>
    <li>What are you going to work on today?</li>
    <li>What are you waiting on?</li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>Planning Day:</h2>

  <p>
    Planning days will also be be run by the Scrum Master. You'll work with the Product Owner to verify all the work that has been marked as completed has been deployed and works as intended. Then you'll pull new stories into the next sprint and estimate them with the rest of the team. These stories will be kept up to date during the week as you work on them.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Workflow:</h2>

  <p>
    Each team will have their own code repository on GitHub. The master branch is protected, meaning it only accepts merge commits from Pull Requests. All new code for features or fixes must written on a branch, then submitted as a PR. A continuous integration tool will run tests on each PR, all tests must pass and coverage needs to stay above 80%. Each PR needs to be reviewed by at least one member of the team before it can be accepted and merged into master. Once a PR is merged, the CI tool will run a deployment to Heroku keeping the production site updated with the new features.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The client has access to this site in order to track progress, so make sure that the master branch works as intended!</strong>
