  <h1>Final Project</h1>

  <hr>

  <p>
    The goal of this project is to emulate a real-world agency process to plan, design, and build a working web application according to client specifications and employer defined workflows. It will utilize everything you've learned this year:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Semantic HTML</li>
    <li>Responsive CSS</li>
    <li>Front-end JavaScript</li>
    <li>Back-end Python</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL Database</li>
    <li>Agile Process</li>
    <li>Security Objectives</li>
    <li>Feature Branch Git Workflow</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  
  <h2>The Teams</h2>

  <p>
    Each team is composed of around four developers. As a group, you'll choose two people to take on the roles of Project Manager and DevOps. <strong>Note, these roles are not a hiearchy.</strong> All members of the group have equal say in decision making. These roles are just to divide areas of responsibility:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Project Manager:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsible for keeping stories up to date in the project management software.</li>
        <li>Will run daily stand-up and weekly planning meetings.</li>
        <li><a href="project-management.html">See more details about Project Management.</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>DevOps:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsible for maintaining the repository on GitHub, Heroku, and Travis CI.</li>
        <li>Will run Pull Request reviews.</li>
        <li><a href="git-workflow.html">See more details about the Git Workflow.</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul> 

  <p>
    To sum it up, if I have a question about your progress I'll ask the PM and if I have a question about your code I'll ask DevOps.

  <h2>The Product</h2>

  <p>
    You are reproducing the college portal. It would take months to build the whole thing, so you're only working on a small subset of features. Most of the user stories have already been written for you, but you will be editing and adding to them as you work.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The first thing you need to do as a group is to read through the user stories and get an idea of the scope of the project.</li>
    <li>Write down a list of the unique Actors and Assets.</li>
    <li>Create a Threat Model using Google Sheets and add a link to it in the Documentation list on Trello.</li>
    <li>Then add your Security Objectives to the descriptions of any related user stories.</li>
    <li>With your knowledge of actors and assets, you can now create a Database Diagram using Draw.io, adding the link to the Documentation on Trello.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Treat your threat model and database diagram as rough drafts to get you started. You will change them over time as you learn more about the product you're building. Documentation is only helpful if it's up to date, so look at it often. You should also add any other resources you create to Trello, like adding drawings or designs for a story.
  </p>

  <h2>The Schedule</h2>

  <p>
    This is a four week project. Each week will start with a planning day to prep a week's worth of stories and review the previous week's deployment.
