  <h1>Tech Talk Rubric</h1>

  <p>
    This is just like last semester except a bit more technical. It's a chance to learn about more diverse topics that we couldn't cover in class last semester. And it's also a chance to learn something more than the rest of your peers. Enough to teach it to them!
  </p>

  <p>
    Talks should be 30 minutes long. You can use slides, images, and code samples or demos as needed, but no videos this time. Your talk should answer a few basic questions about your topic:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is it?</li>
    <li>Why does it exist?</li>
    <li>How do you use it?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Thirty minutes is not a long time to learn <em>everything</em> about a topic, so just focus on the basics. I'd rather you give a presentation that teaches a few solid concepts than many shallow concepts.

  <h2>Step 1: Prepare An Outline</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Two weeks</strong> before your presentation date, you need to hand in an outline via Slack. Format is your preference. It should be able to answer your major questions about the topic and provide some insight into how you are dividing your time.

  <h2>Step 2: Rough Draft</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>A week</strong> before your presentation date, you need to hand in a rough draft of your talk. This may be an overview of your slides and/or your code samples. I want to make sure you're on the right track with the topic. That means I should see rough details for <em>every part</em> of your presentation, not just the beginning slides.

  <h2>Step 3: Present!</h2>

  <p>
    This is your chance to be the expert on something none of us know about. Enjoy it! Help us understand your topic and why we might want to learn more ourselves. And relax!! Since none of us know your topic, we're not expecting anything out of you. So just have fun learning a new thing and sharing it with us!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want us to follow along like a workshop, send us install or setup instructions before your talk starts so we can get it out of the way before you get started.
