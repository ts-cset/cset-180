  <h2>Step 1: Pick a Topic</h2>

  <p>
    I'm going to drop a big list of topics in Discord. Each topic has a number. Respond to the post with the number corresponding to the topic you want to talk about. First reply of a number gets it.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Some topics are just the name of a piece of technology, while others are a type of technology with an example of it in paranthesis. For this latter group, teach us about the type of technology more so than how to use the specific example. But you should use the example to help us understand the topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on the topics chosen, I'll sort them into the dates I have picked. We'll do two presentations at the start of class on Fridays. You'll have a few weeks to prepare.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Prepare Your Topic</h2>

  <p>
    This is just like last semester except a bit more technical, and for two reasons. One, it get's us all to learn about diverse topics that we can't cover in class. And two, you learn something really well when you have to teach it to others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Talks should be 30 minutes long. You can use slides, images, and code samples as needed, but no videos this time. Your talk should answer a few basic questions about your topic:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is it?</li>
    <li>Why does it exist?</li>
    <li>How do you use it?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Thirty minutes is not a long time to learn <em>everything</em> about a topic, so just focus on the basics. I'd rather you give a presentation that teaches a few solid concepts than many shallow concepts.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Rough Draft</h2>

  <p>
    A week before your presentation, you need to hand in an outline of your talk showing some rough detail of the entirety as well as a portion of your slides covering at least a third of your outline. I want to make sure you're on the right track with the topic.
  </p>

  <p>
    The outline can be in whatever format you choose, like a markdown file or Google Doc. Send it via Discord. You don't have to send me the slides, I just want to review them. Style is not important, just the content.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: Present!</h2>

  <p>
    This is your chance to be the expert on something none of us know about. Enjoy it! Help us understand your topic and why we might want to learn more ourselves. And relax!! Since none of us know your topic, we're not expecting anything out of you. So just have fun learning a new thing and sharing it with us!
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want us to follow along like a workshop, send us install or setup instructions before your talk starts so we can get it out of the way before you get started.

        <th>Content</th>
        <td>Content was too basic or askew from our coursework to be relevant. Focused too much on concept or application alone. Incomplete intro to topic.</td>
        <td>Content was relevant to our current understanding of programming and served as a good intro to the topic. Good mix of concepts and application.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Organization</th>
        <td>Content was presented haphazardly, redundantly, or contained gaps between concepts.</td>

        <th>Documentation</th>
        <td>Content provided no supporting documentation.</td>

        <th>Originality</th>
        <td>Presentation relied solely on examples found in documentation or articles.</td>
        <td>Presentation used some examples from topic's documentation but also created other original examples to show full understanding of material.</td>
